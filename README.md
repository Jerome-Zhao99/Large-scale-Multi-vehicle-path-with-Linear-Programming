NHG is a chain store whose business scope covers 123 stores in six states in the northeast. Due  to the increase in distribution demand, we need to re-estimate its internal transportation mileage and  require the planned route to be the shortest.  Among them, the information we have obtained is the matrix distance between 123 stores, the  number of deliveries corresponding to the number of stores that need to be delivered each week,  and the number of goods that need to be delivered every day.  The case requires that all vehicles must depart from the distribution center and must return to  the distribution center within two days at the latest, and store orders on different dates cannot be  grouped on the same day's route. At the same time, the case gives us quite a lot of constraints. For example, the driver's duty time  should be less than 14 hours or the driver's maximum driving time is 11 hours. The duty time  includes the driver's driving time, waiting time, and unloading time; the vehicle load must be less  than 3200 ft3; the unloading rate is 0.03 minutes/ft3, and the unloading time of less than 30 minutes  is also counted as 30 minutes; the vehicle speed is set at 40 mph; and the service time is 8:00-18:00
